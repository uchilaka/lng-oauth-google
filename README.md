# About the lng-oauth-google Library

This library is part of the family of LarCity JS libraries. It was written to address the following use-cases:

* Provide a wrapper for Google's JS library to automatically inject the Google OAuth JS library into an AngularJS Project.
* Easily maintain service (factory) features across LarCity projects.

I aspire to be a contributing member of the  share it with you as-is, to help with your own projects.

# Setting up the Example Project

To get started, you can setup and run the example project. To do so, follow these steps:

## 1. Update the library within the `example/` directory

* cd into the `example/` directory from the root of the library
* run `bower update`. This will download dependencies and set them up to be available to the `index.html` script.
* Run `example/index.html` in your test browser

# Enjoy.
